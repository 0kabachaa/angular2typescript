```sh
npm install
jspm install
```

You'll need an HTTP serter.  For example, you can install a simple HTTP server by runing the following command:

```
npm install http-server -g
```

Now switch to the directory of the sample app you want to test and run the following command:

```sh
http-server
```

Open your browser at localhost:8080 to see the sample app.
