This is a repository for code samples for the upcoming book by Yakov Fain and Anton Moiseev <a href="https://manning.com/books/angular-2-development-with-typescript">Angular 2 Development with TypeScript</a>. 

All code samples were upgraded to Angular 2.0 Final

**IMPORTANT:** If you already have an older version of Node.js installed, upgrade it to the current one to avoid errors during npm install.

To start a new SystemJS-based project use the seed project from chapter 2. To create a new Webpack-based project use the seed angular2-webpack-seed from chapter 10.

The video with a code review of a sample online auction application that we gradually develop in the book is located at https://youtu.be/I809tajbVk4.

It'll help you in getting started while reading Chapter 2.

This repo has some extra code samples that we use during our trainings. They didn't didn't make it into the book, but we decided to post them here in the folders called extras. While most of the book code samples are SystemJS-based apps, we started creating their Angular-CLI versions. For example, in chapter3/extras you'll find router samples in one CLI project. To run a specific app, change the value of the main property in the angular-cli.json file to point at the appropriate main file.
